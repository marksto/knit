# knit

Thin wrapper around Java Executors/Threads"

## Usage

```Clojure
(use 'knit.core)
```

Executor can be `:fixed` `:cached` `:single` `:scheduled`, matching the
corresponding Java instances.

```Clojure
(def x (executors :fixed))
```
With all options
```clojure
(def x (executors :fixed :num-threads 3 :thread-factory a-thread-factory))
```

```Submit a task to executor
(execute x #(println "Hello World"))
```

Create your own ThreadFactory.

```clojure
(def tf (thread-factory))
```
With all options
```clojure
(def tf (thread-factory :thread-group a-thread-group :deamon false))
```

Create ScheduledFuture instances:

```clojure
(schedule :at-fixed-rate 200 #(println "hello world"))

```
Supports `:at-fixed-rate`, `:with-fixed-delay`, `:once`, matching the
corresponding Java methods.

With all options:
```clojure
(schedule :at-fixed-rate 2 #(println "hello world")
          :initital-delay 1
          :num-threads 4
          :thread-factory a-thread-factory
          :unit :mins)
```

Time units are `:ns`, `:us`, `:ms`, `:secs`, `:mins`, `:hours`, `:days`.
